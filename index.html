            On 4.02.2023, I heard a sad news that Abraham Lempel has died. He was 86. 
            The news say that he was a grand father of all modern compresion algorithms. Today, everybody knows 
            evrybody knows words mp3, jpeg, or zip. But just a few know who invented this thing for us.
            In 1977 Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv printed his article about algorithm to loosless pack the data.
            Later in 1984 Terry Welch suggest a litlle modified version of the algorithm which we now know as LZW compression algorithm.
            Their fundamental ideas lay in the bottom of all modern compression method.

        <div class="main-para"> I decided to dedicate my project to Abraham Lempel. In our journey we will meet prof Abraham Lempel,
            learn the original idea of his compresion algorithm. 
            You will be able even try to compress something with Python implementation of LZW algoritm.
