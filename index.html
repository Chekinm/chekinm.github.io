            On 4.02.2023, I heard a sad news that Abraham Lempel has died. He was 86. 
            The news say that he is a grand father of all modern compresion algorithms. Today, everybody knows 
            evrybody knows words mp3, jpeg, or zip. But just a few know who invented this thing for us.
        </p>    
        <p> I decided to dedicate my project to Abraham. In our journey we will meet prof Abraham Lempel,
            learn the original idea of his compresion algorithm. 
            We will even write a simple implementation of his algoritm in python. 
        <p>Ready. Let's go!</p>
