3.1 Text. On 4.o2.2023, i heard in news feed that Abraham Lempel was died at his (how many) 
the news says that he is a father of modern compresion algorithm. like that which evrybody knows novadys.
evrybody knows mp3, jpeg, or zip format. But just a few know how invented this thig for us.

I decided to dedicate my project to Agraham. In ourjourney we will meet prof Abraham Lempel,
learn the original idea of the compresion algorithm. 
We even write simple implementation of this algoritm in python. Ready. Let's go!


4. Bio. Some facts from wiki photos.

5. Python implementation.

6. LZV algorithm in modern worlds. 
7. Bibliography. Links to interesting pages.
