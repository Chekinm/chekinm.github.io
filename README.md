# Abraham Lempel tribute page

To be able to start studying in a boot camp, I was asked to make a html/css project.

On February 4, 2023, I heard the sad news that Abraham Lempel had passed away. He was 86 years old. The news said that he was the grandfather of all modern compression algorithms. Today, everybody knows words like MP3, JPEG, or ZIP, but only a few know who invented these technologies for us. In 1977, Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv published their article about a lossless data compression algorithm. Later, in 1984, Terry Welch suggested a slightly modified version of this algorithm, which we now know as the LZW compression algorithm. Their fundamental ideas are at the core of all modern compression methods.

So I decided to dedicate my project to Abraham and his ideas.

The project uses pure HTML5 and CSS for design, and Python with Pyscript framework for automation. 

And yes, it has the LZW algorithm implemented inside.
