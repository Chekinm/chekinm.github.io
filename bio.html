            Prof. Lempel was born in Poland in 1936. He commenced his studies at the Technion in 1959, and finished his 
            PhD 8 years later. He taught Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and in 1981-1984 served as dean of
            the Henry and Marilyn Taub Faculty of Computer Science.
            He founded the HP Labs Israel, and was put in charge of the global HP research activities in computer 
            science and engineering, and in Physics. He was also an IEEE fellow, “for contributions to the theory of
            data complexity and to the practice of data compression, and to the algebraic analysis and synthesis of 
            digital sequences”.</div>
            <div class="bio-para">
            In 1977, Prof Lempel, together with Professor Jacob Ziv from the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical 
            and Computer Engineering, published the first version of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm, and in 1979 - the second version. 
            This algorithm enables lossless data compression. Compression algorithms are nowadays an enabling technology for 
            multiple file formats including GIF (images), PDF (files), MP3 (music), and more, as well as digital Cable and
            Satellite TV, and many other modern technologies.</div>

            <div class="bio-para">Here is a quote from the ACM announcement of the 1998 Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award, one 
            of many awards Prof. Lempel received: “The LZ algorithm can be found in virtually every modern computer.
            Most workstations run with one or more LZ compression algorithms in its software, hardware or both. 
            We use the LZ algorithm often without being aware of it, archiving files; installing software that is 
            compressed on a disk; backing up hard drives; and going online. These examples are of the practical impact added to the 
            well-recognized theoretical significance of the work of Dr. Lempel and Dr. Ziv.”</div>
