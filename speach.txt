Hello, dear friends. 

On 4.02.2023, I read a news article  that Abraham Lempel Israel peoneer of computer science has died at his (86),
The article also says that he is a father of modern compresion algorithm. 
It says that he study and works all his life in Haifa Technion university.
I was suprised, that I never knew nothign bout him. 
When I think about theme for my prject I decided to dedicate this work to him, 
and to his algorithm.

First of all, we can learn something abuot Israel computer scince, and people how stood 
in the base of what we now know as "startup nation phenomenon". 

Second - the subject. To be a better programmer you need understand 
how the programms works. Hope you will find it interesting.
  

So, I decided to dedicate my project to Agraham. In our journey we will meet prof 
Abraham Lempel, learn the original idea of the compresion algorithm. 
We even will write simple implementation of this algoritm in python. 

Ready. Let's go!


About techical side of the project.
1. Implementation.  

    It takes me something about 30 to 40  hour to do all the job, excluding thinking about conception itself.
2. Techology used.
    It is HTML 5 site with PyScript used for automation of the html page.
    I try to do it on pure Pyscript, but stuck on table deletion, and was had to use JS python module  in PYscript, 
    as I still don't know JSscript.
    By the road I leared a lot abuut DOM conception.
3. Review of html's

4. Review of css's

5. Responsive implementaion.

6. Python algorithm.

7 Pyscript implementation.
