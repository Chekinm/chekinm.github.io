Hello, dear friends. 

On 4.o2.2023, I read a news article  that Abraham Lempel has died at his (how many),
the article also says that he is a father of modern compresion algorithm. 
It says that he study and works all his life in Haifa Technion university.
I was suprised, that I never knew nothign bout him. 
When I think about theme for my prject I decided to dedicate this work to him, 
and to his algorithm.

Fist of all, we learn something albut Israel computer scince, and people how stays 
in fundament of what we now know as "startup nation phenomenon". 

Second - the subject. To be a better programmer you need understand 
how the programms works. Hope you will find it interesting.
I tried to described it as simpel as it could be.   

So, I decided to dedicate my project to Agraham. In our journey we will meet prof 
Abraham Lempel, learn the original idea of the compresion algorithm. 
We even will write simple implementation of this algoritm in python. 
Also we will learn where this fundumentl algorithm is used nowdays.
Ready. Let's go!


About techical side of the project.
1. Implementation.  
2. Techology used.
3. Revuew of html's
4. Review of css's 
5. Responsive implementaion. Mobile first, reactive elements.
